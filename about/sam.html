    <p>Sam is a person who loves to enjoy doing downright goofy things with his friends. He is a certified goober that mostly plays games that give him the most creative freedom as possible like his personal favourite Pirate Game and his second favourite which is The Great Three Boulders. He joined this circus due to his skill with writing dumb paragraphs and collecting/creating images, audio and of course some general coding.</p>
