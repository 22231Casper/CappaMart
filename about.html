    <p>Our team started small, only having $2.50 to their name. They only scraped by on the streets of Hamilton, selling drawn images of things they found funny. Until the global pandemic attacked, leaving the physical images in ruins. With no other choice the team decided to make an attemps to sell their images online. It was a smashing success making so much money that the company of Cappa $ Co was founded. Now that they even got their own currency. They travel the world collecting and selling the most expensive, breath taking and downright silly photos they can find.</p>
